# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Successfully implemented: 1) REMOVED SIGNAL STRATEGY - Updated tradingModeOptions to only include 'Simple' and 'Own' modes as requested, 2) IMPLEMENTED ORDER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM - Added comprehensive order management with entryOrders and exitOrders arrays, each order containing indent% and volume% fields for precise control, 3) 100% DEPOSIT VALIDATION - Added calculateRemainingDeposit function with real-time validation ensuring orders total exactly 100% of deposit volume, with visual warnings and color-coded feedback, 4) ENTRY OWN MODE UI - Created complete order grid interface (up to 40 orders) with add/remove functionality, partial placement slider (1-100%), and pulling up order grid dropdown (1-10%), 5) EXIT OWN MODE UI - Implemented identical order distribution system for exit trades with same UI components and validation logic, 6) ORDER MANAGEMENT - Added comprehensive functions (addEntryOrder, removeEntryOrder, updateEntryOrder, addExitOrder, removeExitOrder, updateExitOrder) for complete order lifecycle management, 7) ENHANCED UI - Added proper grid layout with indent%/volume%/action columns, trash icons for order removal, plus button for adding orders, range sliders for advanced settings, and proper validation feedback. Both Entry and Exit sections now support Own strategy with complete order distribution matching screenshot requirements while maintaining TRADE ENTRY CONDITIONS functionality."

      message: "✅ OWN STRATEGY REFINEMENTS COMPLETED: User requested specific refinements to Own strategy settings. Successfully implemented: 1) PARTIAL PLACEMENT ENHANCEMENT - Changed 'Partial Placement of a Grid of Orders (%)' from percentage slider to dynamic dropdown based on order count (e.g., if 3 orders: choice 1-3, if 10 orders: choice 1-10), updated initialization from 50% to 1 order for both entry and exit, 2) REMOVED DUPLICATE SETTINGS - Deleted 'Pulling Up the Order Grid' from Own strategy containers since identical setting exists in advanced settings section below, preventing UI duplication, 3) ADVANCED SETTINGS CLEANUP - Added conditional hiding for Own strategy to remove unnecessary settings: 'Overlapping Price Changes (%)', 'Grid of Orders', '% Martingale', 'Indent (%)', and 'Logarithmic Distribution of Prices' - streamlined interface focuses on Own strategy essentials, 4) CONSISTENT APPLICATION - Applied identical changes to both Entry and Exit sections ensuring uniform behavior and clean interface. Own strategy now has focused, dedicated settings while Simple strategy retains full advanced configuration options."

      message: "✅ MY PURCHASES SECTION & PRODUCT EDITOR FIXES COMPLETED: User requested two major enhancements. Successfully implemented: 1) MY PURCHASES SECTION - Added 'My Purchases' filter to marketplace navigation, implemented comprehensive purchase management with localStorage persistence (`user_purchases_${user.id}`), created handlePurchase function with purchase tracking (purchaseId, timestamp), added isPurchased check function for authorization, built PurchasedProductModal with full content access including text/images/videos/files/attachments with read-only view, modified PortfolioCard to show 'Access Content' button (green) for purchased items vs 'Purchase Now' (blue) for unpurchased, implemented proper user authorization ensuring users only see their own purchases, 2) PRODUCT EDITOR DELETION FIXES - Added delete buttons to text content blocks with proper validation (minimum 1 block protection), verified existing delete functionality for image/video/file blocks was already implemented, ensured dynamic UI updates without page refresh using removeContentBlock function. Both features provide complete functionality with proper user experience, data persistence, and security measures."

      message: "🚨 CRITICAL TABLE MISMATCH ISSUE DISCOVERED: After testing bot creation and data synchronization fixes, I found the EXACT ROOT CAUSE of the reported issue 'Bot creation shows success notification but bot disappears from My Bots'. The problem is a critical table name mismatch: Backend ai_bots.py uses 'bots' table for all bot operations (create, retrieve, update, delete), while Frontend supabase.js and dataSyncService.js correctly use 'user_bots' table. Backend logs confirm this with 'GET /rest/v1/bots HTTP/2 400 Bad Request' errors. The 'bots' table appears to not exist, while 'user_bots' is the correct table. This mismatch breaks core functionality - bots are saved to non-existent 'bots' table by backend, but frontend tries to read from 'user_bots' table, causing bots to disappear. SOLUTION: Backend ai_bots.py must be updated to use 'user_bots' table instead of 'bots' table for user-created bots. This is a CRITICAL bug that makes bot creation feature completely unusable."
