# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

CRITICAL FINDINGS: The original bypass vulnerability where unlimited bots could be created is COMPLETELY ELIMINATED. The endpoint now: 1) Properly counts existing user bots using correct database schema, 2) Checks subscription limits from subscriptions table, 3) Raises HTTP 403 errors when limits exceeded, 4) Provides Super Admin unlimited access, 5) Has additional RLS protection preventing unauthorized access.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The user is experiencing the 409 error because: 1) Frontend is calling POST /api/auth/user/{user_id}/profile for profile updates, 2) User profile already exists in database with unique constraint on user_id, 3) POST endpoint tries to INSERT new record, violating unique constraint, 4) Backend logs confirm exact error: 'duplicate key value violates unique constraint user_profiles_user_id_key'. BACKEND BEHAVIOR VERIFICATION: ✅ POST correctly fails for existing profiles (expected behavior), ✅ PUT correctly updates existing profiles, ❌ Database schema issue - foreign key constraint prevents creation for non-existing users.

TESTING RESULTS (15/21 tests passed, 71.4% success rate): ✅ WORKING SYSTEMS - Server health endpoints (API root, status, health) all operational, Authentication health check working with Supabase connected, UUID user_id format properly supported and accepted by backend, Bot creation API working correctly with UUID (created bot ID: 4a725c03...), Webhook system and feed retrieval operational, Super admin setup working. ❌ CRITICAL FAILURES - User signup failing with 'Database error saving new user' (HTTP 400), ALL portfolio endpoints (/portfolios, /portfolios/create, /user/portfolios) return HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, Data validation returning HTTP 500 instead of expected HTTP 400 for invalid input. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Portfolio endpoints are implemented in backend routes but encountering server errors during execution, likely due to missing database schema, incorrect Supabase table configuration, or route implementation bugs. Backend infrastructure is ready for portfolio operations (UUID support confirmed) but portfolio creation functionality needs immediate debugging and fixes. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Investigate HTTP 500 errors in portfolio endpoints, fix user signup database issues, implement proper error handling for data validation."

CRITICAL FIX #1 - SUPER ADMIN PLAN REMOVAL ✅: GET /api/auth/subscription/plans endpoint successfully excludes Super Admin plan, only returns expected plans: ['free', 'plus', 'pro'], Super Admin plan completely removed from public API response as requested. CRITICAL FIX #2 - SUBSCRIPTION LIMIT ENFORCEMENT ✅: Free user with 0 products correctly allowed to create first marketplace product (can_create=True, limit=1), Free user with 1 product correctly denied creating second product (can_create=False, limit_reached=True), Super Admin (cd0e9717-f85d-4726-81e9-f260394ead58) has unlimited access (limit=-1, is_super_admin=True).

          comment: "🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY DISCOVERED AND FIXED: Found and resolved a critical bug in subscription limits that allowed users to bypass all restrictions. ROOT CAUSE: The backend subscription limit checking logic at lines 330 and 379 in auth.py used 'current_count < limit' comparison without validating that current_count is non-negative. This allowed users to send negative values (e.g., current_count=-1) which would always be less than positive limits, bypassing all restrictions. EXPLOITATION CONFIRMED: Testing proved users could create unlimited bots by sending negative current_count values to POST /api/auth/user/{user_id}/subscription/check-limit. This explains how a free user created 6 bots (3 AI + 3 manual) instead of the allowed 1 AI + 2 manual. IMMEDIATE FIX APPLIED: Added input validation at both locations (lines 320-336 and 378-390) to reject negative current_count values with error response: {success: false, message: 'Invalid current_count: must be non-negative', can_create: false}. FIX VERIFICATION: ✅ All negative count exploits blocked (9/9 tests passed), ✅ Normal limits still work (1 AI bot, 2 manual bots for free users), ✅ Super admin unlimited access preserved, ✅ No regressions in existing functionality. SECURITY IMPACT: This was a critical security vulnerability allowing unlimited resource creation. The fix prevents all negative count exploits while maintaining normal functionality.

The seller_reviews table works perfectly (successful INSERT operations with Status: 201), but the user_votes table has a critical data type mismatch. The error 'operator does not exist: uuid = character varying' indicates that the user_id column in the user_votes table is defined as character varying (text) but there's a constraint or comparison expecting UUID type. This is a database schema issue that needs to be fixed in Supabase. The application code is correct, but the database schema is incompatible.

      message: "🚨 CRITICAL SUBSCRIPTION LIMITS BUG DISCOVERED AND FIXED: Comprehensive testing revealed and resolved a critical security vulnerability in the subscription limits system. CRITICAL BUG FOUND: The backend subscription limit checking logic had a fatal flaw where negative current_count values would bypass all limits. When current_count=-1 and limit=1, the comparison -1 < 1 evaluated to True, allowing unlimited bot creation. EXPLOITATION CONFIRMED: Testing confirmed users could create unlimited bots by sending negative current_count values to POST /api/auth/user/{user_id}/subscription/check-limit endpoint. This explains how a free user created 6 bots (3 AI + 3 manual) instead of the allowed 1 AI + 2 manual. IMMEDIATE FIX APPLIED: Added input validation in auth.py lines 320-336 and 378-390 to reject negative current_count values with error message 'Invalid current_count: must be non-negative'. FIX VERIFICATION: ✅ All negative count exploits now blocked (success=False, can_create=False), ✅ Normal subscription limits still work correctly (1 AI bot, 2 manual bots for free users), ✅ Super admin unlimited access preserved, ✅ 100% test success rate (9/9 tests passed).
