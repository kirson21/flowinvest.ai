The AI engineer's initial focus was resolving a  database schema mismatch where  was  instead of , leading to  errors. This involved complex SQL operations to drop RLS policies, alter the column type, and recreate policies, which was successfully completed and verified. Subsequently, the user reported issues with , specifically a  error with No API key found and a missing  column. Diagnosis revealed the  table itself was missing  and  was expected as . After confirming the database schema was corrected and functional, the focus shifted to a persistent frontend authentication issue: the React AuthContext was correctly loading a development test user, but UI components weren't re-rendering, causing the login screen to persist and Supabase requests to lack authentication headers. The immediate task is to fix this React re-rendering problem, which stems from the Supabase auth state listener overriding the manually set development user, leading to a de-authentication loop.

Flow Invest is an AI-powered investment platform for minimalist, scalable, and mobile-responsive use, featuring an AI Feed, customizable Trading Bots, and a Marketplace with rich editing and a review system. It utilizes FastAPI for the backend and Supabase for database and authentication (Email/Password, Google OAuth). Key implemented features include Grok 4 integration for AI bot creation, a Patreon-like Marketplace, advanced bot editing, Reddit-style voting, My Purchases section, Super Admin role, and a Seller Verification System. The overarching goal is **cross-device data synchronization** for all user data (bots, purchases, account, votes, profiles) by fully migrating from  to Supabase. Current challenges include reliable portfolio creation/deletion, accurate data display, and functional voting/ratings systems, with recent efforts focused on resolving database schema and frontend authentication issues for voting and reviews.

Immediately before this summary, the previous AI engineer had successfully resolved a critical  database schema issue where  was  instead of . This fix involved a multi-step process, including identifying and dropping existing RLS policies by name, altering the  column to , recreating foreign key constraints, and finally re-establishing RLS policies using the  script executed manually by the user. Comprehensive backend testing confirmed the voting system was fully functional.

Following this, the user reported a new issue with the  system, specifically a  error (No API key found in request). Initial diagnosis revealed two problems: a missing  column in the  table and the  column expecting a  but receiving a string. These database schema issues for  were diagnosed and implicitly fixed during testing, confirming the  database functionality (201 status with proper UUID schema).

The investigation then shifted to a persistent frontend authentication problem. Despite enabling a development test user in  and console logs confirming the test user was loaded and authenticated (, , ), the application's UI continuously displayed the login screen. Debugging revealed a race condition or timing issue where the Supabase  listener was being triggered with a  session *after* the development test user was manually set, effectively de-authenticating the user and causing  components to redirect to the login screen. The current state is that the frontend routing is showing a login screen because the auth state listener is overriding the manually set test user.
