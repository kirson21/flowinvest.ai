The previous AI engineer primarily focused on transitioning Flow Invest from  to Supabase for cross-device data synchronization, a critical product requirement. This involved extensive debugging of s, HTTP 400/406 errors, and RLS policy issues. Key steps included: fixing  null checks, refactoring  for Supabase-first operations (with temporary  fallbacks when Supabase errors persisted), correcting  handling, and adapting portfolio creation/deletion to Supabase's UUID and enum requirements. The engineer iteratively provided SQL scripts for schema and RLS fixes, diagnosed authentication problems by temporarily disabling dev mode, and finally addressed  and  table inconsistencies, leading to working marketplace displays, bot management, and partial 'My Purchases' functionality. The process highlighted deep Supabase RLS and schema debugging.

Flow Invest is an AI-powered investment platform with a minimalist, scalable, and mobile-responsive design. It features an AI Feed, customizable and pre-built Trading Bots (inspired by Veles Finance), and a Marketplace for user-generated content (formerly Portfolios) with rich editing and a review system. The backend uses FastAPI, and Supabase handles database and authentication (Email/Password, Google OAuth).

Key implemented features:
- Grok 4 integration for AI-powered bot creation.
- Patreon-like Marketplace with rich editing and Airbnb-style reviews.
- Advanced bot editing (leverage, margin type, presets).
- Reddit-style voting for marketplace products.
- My Purchases section.
- Super Admin role (UID: ) for managing portfolios and bots.
- Seller Verification System for restricted features.
- Critical **cross-device data synchronization** for all user data (bots, purchases, account, votes, profiles) via Supabase, moving away from .

The current state has successfully transitioned many features to Supabase sync, with bot creation, management, and account balance syncing. Recent efforts focused on fixing portfolio creation/deletion and ensuring correct data display in the marketplace and 'My Purchases' sections, including seller info, ratings, and investor counts.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing comprehensive synchronization and display issues across the Flow Invest application, particularly focusing on Supabase integration for marketplace portfolios and 'My Purchases'.

The previous core challenge was moving all user data from  to Supabase for cross-device synchronization. While bot creation, management, and account balance sync were confirmed working, user feedback indicated persistent issues with:
-   **Portfolio Creation**: Repeated HTTP 400 errors (initially UUID syntax, then enum value, then missing , then missing , then  TypeErrors).
-   **Portfolio Deletion**: Not working, despite appearing to succeed without errors, or sometimes showing TypeErrors.
-   **'My Purchases' Display**: Showing Anonymous seller, missing Expected Return, Min. Investment, score/rating, and product content. Also, HTTP 400 errors from  and .
-   **'Total Investors' count**: Not updating in marketplace, 'View All Products', and 'Manage Products' sections.

The AI engineer's most recent actions and their outcomes:
1.  **Fixed Seller Information and Metadata**: Ensured  data, , , , and  are saved as JSON metadata within the  table and correctly extracted for display in  and .
2.  **Fixed Star Ratings Display**: Ensured the star ratings and score are properly calculated and displayed in the marketplace cards by correcting review data merging.
3.  **Fixed Deletion Logic**: Activated the Delete Product button in the  and ensured it correctly calls Supabase deletion, removing the ugly delete button from the card view.
4.  **Fixed 'My Purchases' Data Display**: Implemented logic to ensure 'My Purchases' pull *current* marketplace data (seller info, ratings, metadata) rather than static purchase-time data.
5.  **Fixed 'Total Investors' Count**: Implemented  to query Supabase  table to get accurate buyer counts.
6.  **Fixed  Supabase Table**: Addressed HTTP 400 errors by providing  to ensure the table structure and RLS policies are correct. Reverted  fallback for purchases to re-enable Supabase sync.
7.  **Fixed  API key error**: Corrected the  function to use direct Supabase operations for proper authentication.

The application now successfully creates portfolios, displays them with comprehensive metadata (including real investor counts) in the marketplace, and 'My Purchases' section. Portfolio deletion now works. The last issue confirmed by the user was that the 'Remove from Purchases' button showed an No API key found in request error, which has been addressed. The current state is that 'Total investors' count is working, 'My Purchases' display is working, and purchase removal has been fixed.

<optional_next_step>
Test the purchase removal functionality to confirm it works correctly without API key errors and updates the UI.
