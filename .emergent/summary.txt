The AI engineer successfully built the Flow Invest MVP from scratch, initially focusing on a complete frontend-only application with mock data, showcasing core features like AI Feed, Trading Bots, Portfolios, and a mock login system. Subsequent work transitioned to integrating real data, specifically a webhook for investment news updates. This involved significant backend development with FastAPI and MongoDB, including translation capabilities via OpenAI. The engineer then enhanced the webhook to accept specific OpenAI API response formats. The latest major effort involves a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul of the Trading Bots section, adding complex features like detailed bot performance charts, an AI-powered bot creator, and advanced manual bot settings, inspired by Veles Finance. The work is currently focused on implementing these detailed bot builder UI components.

The goal is to build Flow Invest, a minimalist, AI-powered investment app as a scalable MVP, mobile-friendly for web. Initial requirements included a specific color palette (, , ), Comfortaa font, theme (Light/Dark) and language (English/Russian) toggles, a mock login system (Email, Phone, Google), and a bottom navigation. The app features:
1.  **AI Feed (Main Screen)**: Simulates AI-generated financial news summaries (5-10 sentences) with a visual market sentiment score (0-100, Green/Yellow/Red indicators), updating every 3-4 hours (manual refresh).
2.  **Trading Bots**: Sections for Pre-built bots (static examples with stats like PnL, risk, exchange) and My bots (placeholder UI), with a Create Your Own Bot flow (simplified Veles Finance UX for MVP) allowing selection of exchange, strategy, risk, and trading pair.
3.  **Ready-Made Portfolios**: A simple marketplace UI with sample portfolios (name, description, risk, assets breakdown) and a Create Your Portfolio button (no logic).
AI integration initially used placeholder data but was structured for future OpenAI API and RSS feeds. Backend logic was initially mocked, with plans for Supabase/Firebase and n8n integration.
Subsequent requests:
-   **Webhook Integration**: Create a POST webhook () to receive investment news JSON (title, summary, sentiment, source, timestamp) from n8n, store latest 20 entries in  (MongoDB), and display them in the AI Feed with specified formatting and visual sentiment.
-   **Localization for AI Feed**: Remove Simulate Webhook, display only real entries, and automatically translate news  and  to Russian () if selected, using OpenAI (sk-svcacct-...) with caching.
-   **OpenAI Webhook Format**: Update the webhook to accept a nested OpenAI API response structure (, , ).
-   **Trading Bots UI/UX Update**:
    -   **Pre-built Bots**: Replace Settings with Run Bot (modal for API keys/OAuth mock), View Details to show P&L line chart with 7/30/90/180-day filters, replace Active toggle with static Connected/Not Connected status.
    -   **My Bots**: Add AI Chat for bot creation (natural language prompts, e.g., Create a bot...), with an optional Advanced Settings button for traditional manual configuration, mimicking  for detailed settings (Bot Name, API Key, Trade Type, Trading Pair (up to 100 pairs), Deposit Configuration, Advanced Settings Toggle (collapsible) including Trading Mode Options, Advanced Parameters, Special Features, Exit Trade Settings (Take Profit, Risk Management), Bot Testing and Simulation (test button, period selector, performance metrics).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React, React Context API, , Tailwind CSS (with ), Radix UI components,  for API calls, Local Storage for persistence.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (via ),  for environment variables,  for CORS.
-   **AI/Integration**: OpenAI API (for translation),  library, n8n (for webhook data).
-   **Design Patterns**: Mock data for initial MVP, modular component design, responsive UI, theme/language toggling.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:
-   **Frontend**: React application served on port 3000.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI application served on port 8001.
-   **Database**: MongoDB.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

-   : The main React application entry point, setting up  for navigation and integrating the main application layout (). Initially had a placeholder Hello World component.
-    & : Global CSS files, updated to incorporate the custom color palette, Comfortaa font, and remove default React app styles.
-   : Centralized mock data for all frontend components (AI Feed, Trading Bots, Portfolios). This was crucial for the initial MVP, allowing full UI/UX without a backend.
-   : Implements the bottom navigation menu to switch between main app sections (AI Feed, Trading Bots, Ready-Made Portfolios).
-   : This component started as a mock feed, then was heavily refactored to consume data from the backend webhook, include real-time refresh, sentiment visualization, and language localization (English/Russian translation using OpenAI).
-   : The primary component for displaying and managing trading bots. It was first a static display, then enhanced significantly to include Run Bot and View Details modals for pre-built bots, and an AI Bot Creator and Advanced Settings for user-created bots.
-   : New component to handle the mock API key/OAuth connection for Run Bot functionality.
-   : New component for displaying mock P&L charts and detailed bot performance statistics.
-   : New component for the chat-based AI bot creation interface.
-   : New component initiated to implement the detailed, Veles Finance-inspired advanced bot settings.
-   : New file to hold the mock data for 100+ trading pairs used in the Advanced Bot Builder.
-   : Handles API calls from the frontend to the backend, abstracting  requests.
-   : The core FastAPI application. It was modified to:
    -   Include  and  for MongoDB.
    -   Mount  prefixed with .
    -   Define  (root) and  endpoints initially.
    -   Later, it integrated the  and  routes/services.
    -   Refactored import paths for modularity ( instead of direct file imports).
-   : Defines Pydantic models for  (schema for news items) and , used for data validation and MongoDB interaction.
-   : Contains FastAPI endpoints for the AI news webhook. Initially, it accepted a flat JSON structure. Later, it was updated to specifically parse the nested OpenAI API response format, and a  endpoint was added for backward compatibility. It handles data storage to MongoDB and triggering translations.
-   : New service responsible for managing OpenAI API calls for translation (English to Russian) and caching translated content in MongoDB ( collection) to improve performance. It uses the  library.
-    & : Documentation files detailing the webhook setup, API specifications, n8n integration, and security considerations, including the specific OpenAI API payload format.

<pending_tasks>
-   Completion and full integration of the detailed Advanced Settings for bot creation, specifically the remaining sections beyond the initial components (e.g., Enter/Exit Trade Settings, Bot Testing).
-   Completion of the  component and its integration into the .
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing the Advanced Settings for the user-created bots section, aiming to replicate the detailed configuration options found on . This work involves a significant UI/UX overhaul for the bot creation flow, moving beyond a simple form to a comprehensive, multi-section interface.

Specifically, the following progress has been made:
-   ****: This new component has been created to house the complex Advanced Settings UI. It is intended to manage various configuration sections like Basic Settings, Trading Pair Management, Deposit Configuration, Enter Trade Settings, Exit Trade Settings, and Bot Testing and Simulation.
-   ****: A new data file was created () to provide mock data for 100+ popular trading pairs. This data will be used within the  component.
-   ****: The creation of this component was just initiated. Its purpose is to provide a dual-coin selection interface (Base/Quote currency) to allow users to choose from the extensive list of trading pairs.

The current focus is on building out these advanced UI elements and ensuring they align with the specified design requirements, even though the backend logic for these new settings is explicitly stated as not required for now (mocked functionality). The goal is to deliver a visually rich and highly interactive Advanced Settings experience for bot creation.
