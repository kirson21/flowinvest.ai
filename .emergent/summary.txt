The previous AI engineer diligently built out the Flow Invest MVP. Key initial tasks involved a migration to Supabase for authentication and data, integration of Grok 4 for AI bot creation, and resolving complex multi-platform deployment challenges. Subsequent efforts focused heavily on UI/UX, including refactoring the Advanced Bot Builder for multi-step navigation, ensuring comprehensive mobile responsiveness across components like the Bot Builder and AI Creator, and transforming the Portfolios section into a dynamic Marketplace. Debugging persistent issues, such as Google OAuth and temporary  bot storage due to RLS, was also central. Recent significant work involved enhancing marketplace product creation with Patreon-like features, fixing image loading and  quota errors via Supabase Storage integration, implementing an Airbnb-style review system, and overhauling My Bots with comprehensive editing capabilities. A Seller Mode was introduced in user settings to manage social profiles and specialties. The immediate focus before this summary was refining how seller information (name, bio, reviews, social links) is displayed on product cards, addressing inaccuracies and ensuring data consistency.

<product_requirements>
The Flow Invest application is conceptualized as a minimalist, AI-powered investment platform, designed for scalability and mobile-friendliness as an MVP. Initial specifications included a distinct UI color palette, Comfortaa font, theme/language toggles, mock login, and bottom navigation. Core functionalities were defined as an AI Feed (news summaries), Trading Bots (pre-built and user-created with Veles Finance-inspired UX), and Ready-Made Portfolios.

The application's architecture evolved from a FastAPI backend with MongoDB to Supabase for robust authentication and data management. Key enhancements included the integration of Grok 4 for AI bot creation, real user authentication (Email/Password, Google OAuth), and multi-platform deployment. Subsequent refinements focused on refactoring the Advanced Bot Builder for multi-step navigation and detailed entry fields, improving overall mobile responsiveness across the app, transforming Portfolios into a dynamic Marketplace, and enabling users to create and publish their own Patreon-like products with optional metadata. Recent features introduced included an Edit button for creator-owned products, a Leave a Review system for sellers, comprehensive bot editing functionalities, and a Seller Mode in user settings allowing the management and display of social links and specialties on product cards.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, primarily utilizing Supabase for database and authentication.

**Directory Structure:**



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Central router. Modified  and  to allow test user in development mode. The  component was also adjusted to correctly handle development mode authentication state.
-   : Supabase authentication context. Temporarily modified to inject a test user for development, and then reverted to original. Logic related to  was considered here.
-   : Manages general app context, including authentication state. Its  logic was indirectly affected by and adapted to the AuthContext changes for development mode testing.
-   : Main layout. Added dynamic bottom padding () to prevent buttons and content from being obscured by the fixed bottom navigation, improving scroll space.
-   : Renamed from Portfolios to Marketplace. Enhanced to prominently display product titles and new optional metadata fields (Risk Level, Expected Return, etc.). The Edit button for product creators was positioned () and styled. Seller specialties are now displayed as badges. The Featured badge positioning was adjusted () and the  given top padding () to prevent overlap with titles on mobile. The  component within this file already supports Telegram.
-   : Implements the product creation interface. Enhanced to include all optional metadata fields. File uploads now leverage  via  (replacing  base64 storage), including upload progress indicators. Mobile responsiveness was addressed by adding generous bottom padding () and adjusting modal height (). It now loads and utilizes actual seller data (name, social links, specialties) from the settings. A  import error causing runtime crashes was fixed.
-   : Placeholder for editing/deleting products. Updated to integrate the new  for managing product attachments. Also updated to load and reflect current seller data from settings when editing. Adjusted bottom padding ().
-   : Displays detailed seller profiles. Its review section was refactored from a pagination system to an Airbnb-style display showing 3 latest reviews with a Show all X reviews toggle. The Contact Seller button was replaced with a Leave a Review button that conditionally appears for purchasers and opens a modal for star rating and text review submission. Scroll space was improved by adding bottom padding to the review submission buttons () and the main modal container (, ).
-   : (NEW FILE) Centralized service for all Supabase Storage operations. Handles uploading various file types (images, videos, documents) to specific Supabase buckets (, , ), generates unique, organized paths (), and provides public URLs and deletion capabilities.
-   : Updated to include expanded mock data for marketplace products, detailed seller profiles with extended social links, and additional review data to support the Airbnb-style review system. Image URLs were initially replaced with placeholders, then restored to Unsplash, and finally moved to  placeholders, pending full Supabase Storage integration for *user-uploaded* content.
-   : Comprehensive profile management. A Seller Mode toggle was added, revealing additional fields for social media links (Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Website, and newly added Telegram) and Specialties (tag-based input). A Manage Products section was added as a placeholder. All seller mode data is persisted in .
-   : Manages bot display. The Delete button on user bot cards was replaced with an Edit button. This button intelligently routes users to either the  or  based on how the bot was initially created. The  function was updated to prevent duplicate bots by updating existing entries rather than creating new ones.
-   : Detailed bot configuration. Modified to accept an  prop, pre-populating form fields for existing bots. The Create Bot button dynamically changes to Update Bot, and a Delete Bot option (with confirmation) is available in edit mode. All steps are now immediately accessible when editing a bot (no sequential navigation required). Responsive bottom padding ( for main container,  for button section) was added to ensure buttons are fully visible on desktop.
-   : AI bot creation UI. Updated to accept an  prop, pre-filling the description and starting in preview mode when editing. The Save Bot button changes to Update Bot, and a Delete Bot option (with confirmation) is available in edit mode.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in refining the display of seller information on marketplace product cards. The user's explicit feedback indicated several inconsistencies that needed addressing:

1.  **Incorrect Seller Name**: The product cards were displaying a generic name (e.g., Hakuna Matata) instead of the user's specified display name from their settings (e.g., Kirson).
2.  **Inaccurate 'About' Information**: The 'About' section on the product card was not pulling content from the user's  field in settings (e.g., CEO flowinvest.ai).
3.  **Misleading Star Ratings**: Even without any reviews, product cards were displaying a 4.8 stars rating, which was inaccurate. The requirement is to show 0 stars if there are no real reviews.
4.  **Display of Unconnected Social Links**: Product cards were showing icons for all social media platforms, even if the user had not provided a link for them. The user explicitly requested that only connected social links (e.g., Telegram, Instagram, Website in their case) should be visible.

The engineer has just begun implementing these fixes, starting with the  to ensure that it correctly incorporates the user's actual display name, bio, and a filtered list of connected social links when a new product is created or an existing one is updated. This foundational change is crucial for the accurate representation of seller profiles on product cards across the marketplace.
