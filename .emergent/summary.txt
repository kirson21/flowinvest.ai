<analysis>
The AI engineer's work primarily revolved around three core areas: stabilizing the NowPayments integration, enhancing financial tracking within the application, and implementing a robust Google Sheets data synchronization feature. Initial efforts addressed critical bugs in the payment system, including fixing  issues and enabling subscription cancellations, alongside improving security by moving API keys to environment variables. A significant portion of the trajectory focused on the Google Sheets integration, which required database schema modifications, development of a dedicated backend service, and creation of API endpoints for data synchronization. A persistent challenge throughout this phase was the detection and removal of hardcoded Google Service Account credentials, repeatedly leading to security breaches and requiring a complete shift to environment variable management. The final stages focused on perfecting user data synchronization, specifically acquiring all user emails by proposing a Supabase RPC function.

The  platform is an AI-powered investment application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and Supabase for auth/database. It features a subscription model (Free, Plus, Pro) with usage limits. The payment system transitioned from Capitalist API to NowPayments, requiring invoice-based payments, IPN webhooks for real-time updates, and robust crypto subscription management (USDT, USDC). Key initial requirements included fixing mobile UI/UX, displaying subscription expiry, ensuring user ID-based payment association, and automatic user profile creation for Google OAuth users. Later, the user explicitly requested an enhanced data structure with monthly reports for  and a new  table. A critical feature was real-time/scheduled Google Sheets integration for  and aggregated  data (Name, Email, Country, Phone, Registration Date, Seller Status, Subscription Status, Total Commission Earned) using a Google Service Account, with an emphasis on secure credential management via environment variables.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented automated Google Sheets synchronization for  and  data, including automated triggers on payment webhooks and user profile updates. A persistent and critical issue has been the presence of hardcoded Google Service Account credentials, which were repeatedly detected and disabled by Google. The AI engineer has completely removed all hardcoded credentials from the codebase, making the system exclusively reliant on environment variables.

The focus then shifted to ensuring all user emails are synced. Initially, only a subset of user emails was available from  and . The user explicitly requested to include emails from the  table for complete user data. The AI engineer developed a Supabase RPC function () that joins  with other profile and subscription tables to gather comprehensive user information, including emails, name, country, phone, and subscription status. The SQL for this RPC function has been prepared and provided to the user for manual execution in the Supabase dashboard due to limitations in programmatic SQL execution. The  has been updated to utilize this RPC function.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the user's manual setup of the Supabase RPC function and then trigger a full Google Sheets sync.
