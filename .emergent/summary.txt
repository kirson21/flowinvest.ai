The previous AI engineer's primary focus was migrating Flow Invest from  to Supabase for cross-device data synchronization. Initially, this involved fixing UI flickering caused by mock data in  and . Subsequently, the engineer addressed the comprehensive migration of social links, notifications, votes, and reviews, introducing  and updating relevant components. A significant portion of the work involved iterative debugging of Supabase SQL schema issues ( for triggers, missing columns) and persistent No API key found, 404, and 400 errors for  and . Despite extensive troubleshooting, including temporary RLS disabling and schema reloads, these API access issues persisted. The last action was adding detailed Supabase client debugging to diagnose the root cause of the persistent connection problems.

<product_requirements>
Flow Invest is an AI-powered investment platform designed for minimalist, scalable, and mobile-responsive use. Key features include an AI Feed, customizable Trading Bots, and a Marketplace for user-generated content with rich editing and a review system. The application uses FastAPI for the backend and Supabase for database operations and authentication (Email/Password, Google OAuth). Implemented features include Grok 4 integration for AI bot creation, a Patreon-like Marketplace with rich editing, advanced bot editing, Reddit-style voting, My Purchases section, Super Admin role for management, and a Seller Verification System. The most critical ongoing requirement is achieving **cross-device data synchronization** for all user data (bots, purchases, account, votes, profiles) via Supabase, fully replacing . Current efforts have transitioned many features, but core challenges remain with reliable portfolio creation/deletion, accurate data display in Marketplace and 'My Purchases', and functional voting/ratings systems.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into debugging persistent Supabase integration issues, specifically the No API key found in request error, 404 errors for the  table, and 400 errors for  when attempting to save data or fetch schema information. This was preventing voting and star ratings from functioning correctly in the marketplace.

The root cause of the initial UI flickering (mock data loading) was addressed by modifying  and  to initialize states without mock data. The comprehensive  to Supabase migration for user settings, votes, and reviews was implemented, centralizing Supabase interactions in  and updating  and  accordingly.

The current challenge is the persistent database access problem. Despite verifying that  and  tables exist in the  schema and have RLS disabled with  permissions, the No API key found and 404/400 errors persist. The AI engineer has tried:
1.  Temporarily easing authentication checks in .
2.  Providing multiple simplified SQL scripts to disable RLS and grant permissions (, , , , ), iterating through user-reported SQL syntax errors.
3.  Instructing the user to manually run  to force Supabase's PostgREST API to refresh its cache, as the tables were confirmed to exist.

The issue is suspected to be a deeper Supabase API configuration problem or an incorrect API URL/Key, where the API layer isn't properly recognizing or exposing the database tables to the frontend, even if they exist in PostgreSQL. The  function also returned a 404, reinforcing this.

The immediate last action was to add highly detailed debugging () to  and a call in  to output comprehensive Supabase client information to the browser console. The engineer is currently awaiting this detailed console output from the user to pinpoint the exact configuration or connectivity issue.
