The AI engineer's work primarily focused on expanding the  application, initially by implementing a comprehensive Custom URLs system for various entities (users, bots, products, posts) and personalized authenticated navigation. This involved significant backend API development for slug management and corresponding frontend routing. Subsequently, the focus shifted to critical bug fixes. The trajectory details the resolution of a Failed to create withdrawal: 0 error in the NowPayments integration, which involved improving backend error handling, ensuring the correct database schema was applied to production (after initial environmental mismatches), and fixing the withdrawal webhook logic for automatic balance deduction. The latest challenge involved resolving a persistent SQL type casting error within the  function, requiring a complex SQL script to drop and recreate dependent database objects with  to correctly update .

<product_requirements>
The  platform is an AI-powered investment application built with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and Supabase for database management and authentication, supporting Free, Plus, and Pro subscription tiers. NowPayments handles crypto invoices and IPN webhooks for real-time USDT/USDC subscription updates.

The initial product requirement aimed to implement a system of unique, user-friendly URLs and sharing functionality for various application elements:
1.  **User Profile Links**: Personalized URLs like  with validation for uniqueness and specific characters.
2.  **Application Section Links**: Direct URLs for core sections: , , , .
3.  **Product and Bot Links**: Unique URLs like  and  with auto-generation and uniqueness validation.
4.  **Feed Post Links**: Unique URLs for each feed post, e.g., .
5.  **Future Proofing**: Support for social sharing and SEO metadata.
6.  **Access Control**: Publicly shared links visible to unauthenticated users if content is marked public.
7.  **Personalized Authenticated URLs**: Logged-in users navigate using personalized paths, e.g., .

Subsequent and current efforts are focused on resolving critical issues:
- Fixing NowPayments webhook signature verification (addressed prior to this trajectory's core).
- Correcting  synchronization to reflect actual user balances.
- Ensuring top-up payment gateways open in new windows without redirection issues.
- Addressing a critical bug preventing successful withdrawal creation and proper balance deduction via NowPayments.

    -   **Summary**: Frontend service for interacting with NowPayments backend APIs.
    -   **Changes**: Examined to understand how withdrawal requests are made and the  usage.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: A consolidated SQL script containing database schema updates, RLS policies, and data migration for custom URLs and company balance synchronization.
    -   **Changes**: This file was the base upon which  was built, indicating the progression of schema consolidation.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: A new, comprehensive SQL script combining all previous schema changes (custom URLs, RLS) with the newly added  table and related functions.
    -   **Changes**: Created by the AI to ensure all necessary database components, including withdrawal functionality, are present for production deployment.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains the SQL definitions for the  table and RPC functions like , , and .
    -   **Changes**: This schema was confirmed to exist but needed to be applied to the production database. Its contents were incorporated into consolidated scripts.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: A targeted SQL script designed to add *only* the withdrawal-related database objects (table, functions, RLS) using  to avoid conflicts.
    -   **Changes**: Created by the AI to address user's  error when applying the full schema. Includes the crucial  function.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: A simple SQL script to manually update a user's balance and temporarily disable/re-enable the trigger.
    -   **Changes**: Created as an immediate fix for the user's balance after a successful withdrawal.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: SQL script to fix the company balance function by explicitly dropping it before recreation.
    -   **Changes**: Addressed PostgreSQL's restriction on changing function return types.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: A very basic SQL script to update the user's balance without involving triggers.
    -   **Changes**: Provided as an alternative quick fix.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The most comprehensive SQL script for fixing the  sync issue, handling all dependencies.
    -   **Changes**: Drops triggers and functions with , then recreates  and its trigger with correct type handling, and updates the user's balance using . This is the final version to be applied.

<pending_tasks>
-   **User Action Required**: Execute the  script in the Supabase SQL Editor. This is crucial for resolving the  synchronization bug and correcting the user's balance.
-   **Environment Variable**: Ensure  is added to the Render backend environment variables.
-   **Deployment**: Push the latest code changes to the Git repository for deployment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical and persistent database issue related to the  synchronization function. This problem manifested as a  error, specifically within the  function, which was being triggered by balance updates.

The previous attempts to fix this involved:
1.  Creating  to correct the  to  casting error.
2.  Creating  and  for temporary balance corrections.
3.  Creating  to drop and recreate the function, as PostgreSQL doesn't allow changing function return types directly.

However, the user reported a new error: . This indicated that the trigger itself needed to be dropped *before* the function could be dropped and recreated.

The current work culminated in the creation of the  script. This script is designed to:
-   **Cleanly remove dependencies**: It proactively drops all related triggers and functions using the  option, ensuring a clean slate.
-   **Recreate correctly**: It then recreates the  function with the proper  type handling () and reinstates the necessary trigger.
-   **Fix user balance**: It includes a command to correctly update the user's balance (deducting the previously successful 0 withdrawal), using  to prevent negative balances.
-   **Test**: It also includes commands to test the manual sync function and display the updated balances.

This comprehensive script is the proposed solution to fully fix the  synchronization issue and correct the user's balance.
