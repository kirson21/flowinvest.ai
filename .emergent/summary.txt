The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles an intricate journey from resolving critical payment and subscription system bugs to implementing a comprehensive data synchronization feature. Initially, efforts focused on stabilizing the NowPayments integration, which involved fixing the  for real-time updates and implementing subscription cancellation. A major challenge was a recurring issue with webhook URLs pointing to incorrect environments (preview vs. production), causing payment updates to fail. This led to the implementation of an email-based validation system for subscriptions.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to financial tracking, adding subscription revenue to the company balance, and introducing a new  column. The final, extensive task was integrating Google Sheets for data synchronization, involving database schema enhancements (monthly reports, commissions table) and a dedicated Google Sheets backend service. A persistent security challenge emerged during this phase: repeatedly identifying and removing hardcoded Google service account credentials and other API keys from the codebase, ensuring all sensitive data is exclusively managed via environment variables for secure deployment.

The  platform is an AI-powered investment application providing subscription-based AI bots and marketplace products. It requires a React frontend, FastAPI backend, Supabase for authentication/database, and a subscription model (Free, Plus, Pro) with usage limits. The payment system transitioned from Capitalist API to NowPayments, necessitating invoice-based payments, IPN webhooks for real-time updates, support for various crypto (USDT, USDC on multiple chains), and robust subscription management (UI, cancellation).

Key functional requirements included fixing mobile UI/UX, displaying subscription expiry, ensuring strict user ID-based payment association (preventing Super Admin defaults), and automatic user profile creation for Google OAuth users. Later, the user explicitly requested enhanced data structure with monthly reports for , a new  table, and real-time (or scheduled) Google Sheets integration for  and aggregated  data (Name, Email, Country, Phone, Registration Date, Seller Status, Subscription Status, Total Commission Earned) using a Google Service Account.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into the implementation of the Google Sheets integration and simultaneously addressing critical security vulnerabilities related to credential management. The Google Sheets integration involved creating new database tables (, ) and modifying the  table to include  for better financial tracking. A new  was developed to handle API interactions and a  router was added for sync endpoints.

A significant challenge arose with deployment failures due to missing Python dependencies (), which was fixed by updating . The most persistent and critical issue has been the presence of hardcoded Google Service Account credentials and other API keys within the codebase, preventing Git repository commits due to security alerts. The AI engineer has repeatedly attempted to move these secrets to environment variables and delete credential files. However, the latest interaction reveals that some Google-related strings (e.g., service account email, client ID) are still being detected, indicating remaining hardcoded values or references. The current work is focused on eradicating these last vestiges of hardcoded credentials to ensure secure deployment.
