The AI engineer's work spanned two primary phases. Initially, it involved resolving critical production issues, notably a Failed to create withdrawal: 0 error in NowPayments and a persistent SQL type-casting error affecting . The latter was addressed by generating a comprehensive  script. Subsequently, the focus shifted entirely to enhancing the application's AI Creator section. This second phase involved creating a new conversational AI agent for designing trading bots, requiring new database tables (, ), backend API development, and significant frontend UI modifications to integrate chat functionality and display AI-generated bot details. Throughout this, the engineer faced challenges with LLM integration (initially  conflicts, then proper re-integration with Universal Key), persistent database  length issues, critical AI context management bugs, and frontend JavaScript/build errors, all of which were systematically addressed and resolved, culminating in a production-ready conversational AI bot creation feature. The final pending item is a user-executed SQL update.

<product_requirements>
The  platform is an AI-powered investment application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and Supabase for database and authentication, supporting Free, Plus, and Pro tiers, using NowPayments for crypto transactions.

Initial requirements focused on:
1.  **Custom URLs**: Personalized user profiles (), application sections (), products (), bots (), and feed posts ().
2.  **Sharing & SEO**: Support for social sharing and SEO metadata.
3.  **Access Control**: Public content accessible to unauthenticated users.
4.  **Personalized Navigation**: Authenticated users navigate via personalized paths (e.g., ).

The current phase is centered on:
-   Resolving a critical bug preventing NowPayments withdrawals and balance deductions. (Addressed by ).
-   Implementing an enhanced **AI Creator** section for trading bots:
    -   **Conversational Interface**: A dialog-based chat for users to interact with an AI agent (like ChatGPT).
    -   **AI Agent Functionality**: The agent asks mandatory questions for better bot design, with all processing occurring in the backend.
    -   **Database**: Separate, flexible  table for AI-generated bots with JSON-based parameters and an  table (30-day retention).
    -   **LLM Integration**: Utilize Emergent's Universal Key, offering GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, and Gemini Flash as model choices.
    -   **UI Updates**: Single Generate with AI button (purple), updated bot cards to show Trade type (Spot/Futures) and multiple trading pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT + 20).
    -   **Agent Prompt**: Incorporate a detailed expert trading systems agent prompt for professional bot specification, including risk management, kill-switches, and mandatory questions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully resolved multiple critical issues within the AI Creator section:

1.  **Database  Error**: Previously, the AI-generated bot data failed to save due to the  field in the *old*  table having a  limit, which was too short. The engineer identified that AI bots were being erroneously saved to  instead of the newly created  table. This was addressed by updating the frontend () and backend () to correctly save AI-generated bots to the  table. A final, crucial step for this fix is for the user to execute an SQL command to expand the  and  column types in the  table to prevent future conflicts when other bot types are saved.

2.  **AI Not Following User Answers / Context Issue**: The AI agent was failing to maintain conversation context, leading it to repeat mandatory questions or ignore user-provided preferences (e.g., futures trading, altcoins). Initially,  management was incorrect, causing new chat sessions for each message. The engineer addressed this by a **complete rewrite** of the backend conversation logic, creating , which correctly handles  for continuity and intelligently parses user inputs to progress through the mandatory questions.

3.  **Frontend Build Syntax Error**: A build failure was reported due to a  in . This was traced to an extra closing brace ( instead of ) and was fixed.

4.  **Bot Preview Display**: The bot preview in the UI was showing  instead of readable information for complex fields. This was addressed by refining the frontend rendering logic in  and other bot display components to correctly parse and display JSON-based bot configurations.

The system is now configured to use the Emergent Universal Key with GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, and Gemini Flash models. The AI agent effectively processes a professional trading prompt, asks mandatory questions, understands user context, and generates production-ready bot specifications, all stored in the  table. The frontend has been updated with a single purple Generate with AI button and enhanced bot cards displaying Trade type and multiple trading pairs.

The frontend environment variable  has been confirmed to point to the user's production Render URL ().

All identified issues have been resolved, and the system functionality has been verified, making the AI Creator feature production-ready, contingent on the user's execution of the final SQL script.
