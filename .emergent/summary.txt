The project began with an AI engineer building , an AI-powered investment platform, from scratch. Key initial work included a React landing page, FastAPI backend, Supabase integration for authentication and subscriptions, and deployment fixes. A major pivot occurred from integrating Capitalist API for crypto payments, which faced issues like shared deposit addresses and complex authentication, to adopting NowPayments. This shift necessitated a complete re-architecture of the payment system, implementing NowPayments' invoice-based gateway and subscription features. The AI engineer meticulously tackled Pydantic conflicts, database schema migrations (fixing constraints), dependency issues (email-validator), backend 500 errors, JWT authentication for subscriptions, and extensive frontend UI/UX enhancements including dynamic minimum amounts, mobile layout fixes, and transaction history pagination. The current focus is refining mobile UI elements after successfully integrating NowPayments.

<product_requirements>
The  platform is an AI-powered investment application. Initial requirements included a high-conversion React landing page, a FastAPI backend, Vercel/Render deployment, user profile updates, Google OAuth, and a Supabase-backed user balance system with notifications. A ChatGPT-style subscription UI with Free, Plus, and Pro plans needed to enforce bot and marketplace product creation limits. The first major update involved integrating Capitalist API for crypto deposits/withdrawals (USDT ERC20/TRC20, USDC ERC20), requiring unique deposit tracking (later clarified to payment references), company/user fund tracking, and a UI with Top up, Withdraw, and Refresh balance. This was superseded by a switch to NowPayments for crypto payments and subscriptions, requiring an invoice-based payment gateway, email-based subscription system, IPN webhooks for real-time updates, and support for USDT (TRX, BSC, SOL, TON) and USDC (ETH, BSC, SOL). The UI also needed updates for new currencies, redirection to the payment gateway, and a subscription management interface.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in fixing mobile UI layout issues within the  application. The current task focuses on the  component, specifically addressing the positioning and responsiveness of the Manage Crypto button. The previous styling, which utilized , was identified as causing layout problems and potential content overflow on mobile devices. The AI engineer is in the process of implementing a responsive layout solution for this section to ensure the button displays correctly and is user-friendly on smaller screens. This work is a continuation of previous UI/UX enhancements, which included optimizing minimum amount displays, adjusting button and modal positioning, and refining padding across various components, particularly in  and , following the successful integration of the NowPayments API and its core functionalities.
