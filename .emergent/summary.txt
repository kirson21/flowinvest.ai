The AI engineer's trajectory focused on building and refining the  application, transitioning from foundational features to complex enhancements and bug fixes. The primary objective was the implementation of a comprehensive Custom URLs system, encompassing user profiles, application sections, marketplace products, bots, and feed posts. This involved extensive backend API development for slug generation, uniqueness validation, and frontend routing adjustments to support both public and authenticated personalized URLs.

Throughout the process, the AI engineer addressed several critical bugs. Key challenges included resolving persistent Supabase RLS policy errors (incorrect column names, type mismatches), fixing NowPayments webhook signature verification, ensuring correct financial data synchronization (), and improving the user experience for top-up payments (new tab opening). UI consistency for share buttons and mobile responsiveness were also tackled. The work concluded by consolidating all database schema and RLS fixes into a single, comprehensive SQL script for user execution, ensuring all implemented features are correctly supported in the database.

The  platform is an AI-powered investment application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and Supabase for authentication and database management, offering Free, Plus, and Pro subscription tiers. The payment system utilizes NowPayments for crypto invoices and IPN webhooks for real-time USDT/USDC subscription updates.

The core problem addressed in this trajectory was to implement a system of unique, user-friendly URLs for various application elements and to enable future sharing functionality. This included:
1.  **User Profile Links**: Personal URLs like , with  validated for uniqueness, alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dashes. Auto-generation of  and the ability for users to change them later were required.
2.  **Application Section Links**: Direct URLs for core sections: , , , .
3.  **Product and Bot Links**: Unique URLs for marketplace products () and user-created bots (), with automatic slug generation and uniqueness validation within their categories.
4.  **Feed Post Links**: Unique URLs for each feed post, e.g., .
5.  **Future Proofing**: Ability to add social sharing and Open Graph/SEO metadata.
6.  **Access Control**: Publicly shared links should only be active if the content is marked as public. Unauthenticated users can view public shared content but must register to access other features.
7.  **Personalized Authenticated URLs**: For logged-in users, the application's internal navigation should use personalized URLs, e.g.,  instead of generic .

Subsequent fixes included: NowPayments webhook signature verification, adding a notification for subscription processing time, fixing the  synchronization to reflect actual user balances, and ensuring top-up payment gateways open in new windows without redirect errors.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively engaged in resolving critical bugs related to the  application's financial tracking and payment experience, as well as consolidating all database-related fixes.

Specifically, the AI engineer addressed:
1.  **Company Balance Synchronization**: The  was not correctly reflecting the actual user balances from . This involved multiple iterations of fixing SQL functions to:
    *   Correctly reference column names ( was incorrectly used instead of  or ).
    *   Handle  data types for user balances, specifically removing incorrect  functions and simplifying conditions to .
    *   Ensure the  function accurately calculates and updates  from the  table.
2.  **Top-up Payment Gateway Experience**: The payment gateway for topping up balances was opening in the same window, causing redirect errors upon completion. The fix involved modifying the frontend () to open the payment gateway in a new tab, allowing the user to remain on the f01i.ai application in the original tab, and automatically closing the payment modal.

The final action taken was to combine all the database-related fixes (Custom URLs schema, RLS policies for public sharing across , , and the corrected  table, and the  sync logic) into a single, comprehensive SQL file named . This file is intended for a single, complete execution by the user in their Supabase SQL Editor to apply all necessary database changes.
