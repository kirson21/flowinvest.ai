The AI engineer successfully built the Flow Invest MVP, evolving it from a frontend-only app with mock data to a full-stack solution. Initial development focused on core UI features (AI Feed, Trading Bots, Portfolios) and a mock login. Subsequent work integrated a FastAPI backend with MongoDB for real investment news via webhook, including OpenAI-powered translation. A major UI/UX overhaul for Trading Bots introduced complex features like performance charts and an AI-powered bot creator. The latest phases involved a comprehensive migration to Supabase for authentication and data persistence, integrating Grok 4 for AI bot creation, and preparing the entire application for Railway deployment. Challenges included intricate UI component integration, persistent Supabase RLS issues, environment variable mismatches (Vite vs. CRA), data mapping errors, and complex Railway deployment configurations related to dependencies and build processes. The engineer provided detailed, iterative fixes and manual instructions to the user for external configurations.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build Flow Invest, a minimalist, AI-powered investment app as a scalable, mobile-friendly MVP. Initial requirements included a specific color palette (, , ), Comfortaa font, theme/language toggles, mock login, and a bottom navigation. Key features were:
1.  **AI Feed**: AI-generated financial news summaries with sentiment scores.
2.  **Trading Bots**: Sections for Pre-built bots and My bots with a Create Your Own Bot flow (simplified Veles Finance UX).
3.  **Ready-Made Portfolios**: A simple marketplace UI.
Subsequent requirements evolved to integrate real data and advanced features:
-   **Webhook Integration**: POST  to receive and store investment news (title, summary, sentiment, source, timestamp) in MongoDB, updating the AI Feed.
-   **Localization for AI Feed**: Automatic English/Russian translation of news using OpenAI, with caching.
-   **OpenAI Webhook Format**: Update webhook to parse nested OpenAI API response structure.
-   **Trading Bots UI/UX Update**: Pre-built Bots to include Run Bot (mock API key/OAuth) and View Details (P&L charts). My Bots to feature an AI Chat for bot creation (natural language prompts, e.g., Create a bot...), with an optional Advanced Settings button mimicking  for detailed configuration (Bot Name, API Key, Trading Pair (100+), Deposit, Entry/Exit, Testing).
-   **Supabase Migration**: Migrate entire backend to Supabase for User Management, Settings, AI Bots, Trading Data, Portfolios, and API Keys, utilizing Supabase Authentication and Edge Functions.
-   **Grok 4 Integration**: Replace existing AI logic with Grok 4 for natural language bot creation, saving structured bot data to Supabase, and integrating into the UI with Edit Bot / Save and Activate options.
-   **Real Authentication System**: Implement user sign-up/login via Google OAuth and Email/Password using Supabase Auth, with access control redirecting unauthenticated users to the login screen.
-   **Railway Deployment**: Deploy the full application (frontend + backend) to Railway with CI/CD via GitHub, configuring custom domains and replicating environment variables.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving persistent deployment issues on Railway. The user reported errors related to package installation ( not found) and shell command execution ( not found) during the Railway build process.

The AI engineer's most recent actions to address these were:
1.  **Dependency Fix**: Removed the  package (which is internal to Emergent) from  and replaced it with the standard usage: openai [-h] [-v] [-b API_BASE] [-k API_KEY] [-p PROXY [PROXY ...]]
              [-o ORGANIZATION] [-t {openai,azure}]
              [--api-version API_VERSION] [--azure-endpoint AZURE_ENDPOINT]
              [--azure-ad-token AZURE_AD_TOKEN] [-V]
              {api,tools,migrate,grit} ...

positional arguments:
  {api,tools,migrate,grit}
    api                 Direct API calls
    tools               Client side tools for convenience

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Set verbosity.
  -b API_BASE, --api-base API_BASE
                        What API base url to use.
  -k API_KEY, --api-key API_KEY
                        What API key to use.
  -p PROXY [PROXY ...], --proxy PROXY [PROXY ...]
                        What proxy to use.
  -o ORGANIZATION, --organization ORGANIZATION
                        Which organization to run as (will use your default
                        organization if not specified)
  -t {openai,azure}, --api-type {openai,azure}
                        The backend API to call, must be `openai` or `azure`
  --api-version API_VERSION
                        The Azure API version, e.g.
                        'https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-
                        services/openai/reference#rest-api-versioning'
  --azure-endpoint AZURE_ENDPOINT
                        The Azure endpoint, e.g.

  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit Python package, also updating the  service to use this standard library.
2.  ** Command Error Fix**: Diagnosed that Railway's build environment might not handle  commands well within certain configurations. The proposed solution involves instructing the user to set up **two separate services** in Railway: one for the backend (root: ) and one for the frontend (root: ), each with simplified, direct build and start commands that don't rely on complex  operations.
    *   For the **backend**, the recommended  is Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://d33sy5i8bnduwe.cloudfront.net/simple/

3.  **Environment Variable Handling**: Ensured that the  files for both frontend and backend correctly use  (for Create React App) and  (for FastAPI) respectively, and that Supabase credentials are properly configured.
4.  **Application State**: The core application functionality, including real user authentication via Supabase, Grok 4 AI bot creation, and the news feed, has been debugged and confirmed to be working within the Emergent environment (after numerous RLS, context, and environment variable fixes). The current state is that the application's code is prepared for Railway, and the AI engineer has provided the user with detailed manual instructions for the Railway dashboard configuration.
