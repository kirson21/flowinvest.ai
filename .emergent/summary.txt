The AI engineer's work trajectory is dominated by two major phases: initial feature integration and an extended, complex debugging effort around deployment issues. Initially, the focus was on integrating an AI Trading Bot Constructor, which involved creating new backend models, routes, and services (OpenAI, Bybit, Encryption) and initial frontend components. This phase also included resolving database query errors, RLS policy conflicts, and Pydantic versioning issues, alongside refactoring import paths and router prefixes.

The second, and more prolonged, phase revolved around resolving persistent Rust compilation errors and path issues during auto-deployment from GitHub to Render. This involved multiple attempts to create Rust-free dependency lists, simplified server files, and custom deployment scripts. Despite numerous local successes, auto-deployment repeatedly failed due to the environment's inability to compile Rust dependencies and incorrect file paths relative to the deployment root. The user eventually requested a rollback to a previous working version, which was performed successfully *on the deployed service* (using Render's rollback) but highlighted that the GitHub repository remained broken. The final solution to achieve deployment involved a radical simplification: deploying an ultra-minimal FastAPI server () with only three core Python packages, completely bypassing Supabase client, OpenAI, and other complex dependencies, confirming the issue was environmental/dependency-related.

<product_requirements>
Flow Invest is an AI-powered investment platform with an AI Feed, customizable Trading Bots, and a Marketplace featuring a review and Reddit-style voting system. It utilizes FastAPI for the backend and Supabase for database and authentication (Email/Password, Google OAuth). Key integrations include Grok 4 for AI bot creation, a Patreon-like Marketplace, a My Purchases section, a Super Admin role, and a Seller Verification System. A primary objective has been cross-device data synchronization through migration from  to Supabase, ensuring reliable portfolio management, accurate data display, and consistent seller profile/product statistics. Recent work prior to the major deployment issues involved fixing  and  schema problems and UI rendering. The overarching new requirement is an **AI Trading Bot Constructor with GPT-5 integration**, allowing users to create, customize, and manage crypto trading bots via JSON configurations, starting with Bybit, including secure API key management, and comprehensive activity logging in Supabase.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React, React Context API, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, , Python.
-   **Database/Auth**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Supabase Auth, Row Level Security (RLS), UPSERT operations.
-   **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (for GPT-5), Grok 4 API.
-   **Data Persistence**: Migration from  to Supabase.
-   **Exchange Integration**: Bybit API (REST & WebSocket).
-   **Security**: AES-256 encryption (initially intended), then simplified to direct Supabase storage.
-   **Deployment**: Docker, Procfile, Render/Railway specific configurations, managing Rust compilation issues.

**Key Files and Changes:**
- : Initially integrated new bot routes. Later, it was subject to multiple full replacements to , , and finally  (which is the currently deployed minimal version). The original  was restored during the rollback phase but proved problematic for deployment.
- : This file was the central point of contention for deployment. It was initially updated with , then downgraded. Later, attempts were made to remove all Rust dependencies, leading to highly minimal versions like  and . Its content was repeatedly simplified to address Rust compilation errors.
- : Modified multiple times to adjust the build and start commands ( removal, direct  commands, switching  to  then  and ultimately ).
- , : New routes for the AI Trading Bot Constructor. Changes included fixing relative imports (from  to ) and correcting router prefixes (removing the redundant ). These were later deleted during the rollback.
- : New Pydantic model for bots. Fixed Pydantic v2  to  validation error. Deleted during rollback.
- : New service for AES-256 encryption. Later deemed unnecessary and was part of the simplification efforts to avoid Rust dependencies. Deleted during rollback.
- : Initially defined the Supabase client. During deployment debugging, its content was altered to use  for direct Supabase REST API calls, bypassing the  client library due to its Rust dependencies.
- : Fixed an issue where it was querying  table by  instead of , resolving a PostgreSQL error.
- : New file created to centralize Supabase client import.
- : A new, extremely minimal FastAPI server created as a last resort to achieve deployment. It contains only basic health and status endpoints, completely omitting all application-specific routes (auth, webhooks, AI bots, trading bots). This is the version currently deployed.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement and integrate the new AI Trading Bot Constructor (database schema, backend APIs, frontend components, WebSocket connections, paper trading, comprehensive logging). This includes integrating predefined strategies and custom natural language strategy creation for trading bots, and ensuring Bybit integration (testnet first).
- Restore full Supabase functionality in the currently deployed minimal backend.
- Re-enable and verify existing authentication features.
- Restore existing AI bot and webhook functionality.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was embroiled in a protracted battle to resolve persistent deployment failures related to Rust compilation issues and incorrect file paths when auto-deploying from GitHub to Render. The user was experiencing Read-only file system errors and  despite numerous attempts to simplify  and adjust deployment commands.

The core problem was that Python packages like , , , and  internally use Rust, which the deployment environment could not compile. After several iterations of downgrading packages, creating Rust-free requirement lists, and fixing  path issues, the ultimate solution was to deploy an **ultra-minimal backend server ()** that intentionally avoids importing any application-specific routes or complex dependencies.

The current state is that the backend is finally deployed and running successfully, but it is a severely stripped-down version.

-   **Deployment Command (Start)**: 

This deployed server only offers basic health and status endpoints (e.g., , , ). All core application functionalities like Supabase database interactions, user authentication, AI bot generation, trading bot features, webhooks, and seller verification are currently *not active* in this deployed version because their respective routes and services are not imported or functional in . The last message confirms this minimal backend is successfully deployed and stable, providing a working foundation to build upon incrementally.

<optional_next_step>
Incrementally add back core application features (Supabase, authentication, AI bots, webhooks) to the deployed backend.
