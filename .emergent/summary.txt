The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Flow Invest application from an initial MVP state to a more robust and synchronized platform. Key achievements include evolving Portfolios into a Marketplace, enhancing the Advanced Bot Builder, implementing a Reddit-style voting system, and adding a Super Admin role. Recent work focused on critical bug fixes related to cross-device data synchronization, primarily due to Supabase table and Row Level Security (RLS) policy mismatches. The engineer systematically debugged authentication hangs, bot creation failures, and data inconsistencies for bots, purchases, and user profiles across devices. A significant architectural decision involved transitioning from -reliant data persistence to a Supabase-first synchronization strategy, with temporary  fallbacks introduced during debugging. The core challenge involved ensuring backend API consistency with frontend data models and correct Supabase schema and RLS configurations, often providing explicit SQL scripts for the user to apply. The work culminated in fixing JavaScript TypeErrors and ensuring crucial sections like bots, balance, and marketplace product display (though not full sync) are operational.

<product_requirements>
Flow Invest is an AI-powered investment platform aiming for a minimalist, scalable, and mobile-responsive design. Its core features include an AI Feed for market news, customizable and pre-built Trading Bots (inspired by Veles Finance), and a Marketplace for user-generated content (formerly Portfolios). The application's backend utilizes FastAPI, with Supabase handling database operations and user authentication (Email/Password, Google OAuth).

Key functionalities implemented and refined include:
- Grok 4 integration for AI-powered bot creation.
- A Patreon-like Marketplace supporting user-generated content with rich editing and an Airbnb-style review system.
- Enhanced bot editing with advanced trading settings (leverage, margin type, presets).
- A Reddit-style voting system for marketplace products.
- A My Purchases section for users.
- A Super Admin role (UID: ) with privileges to manage all user portfolios and pre-built bots, including moving bots between My Bots and Pre-Built Bots.
- A Seller Verification System to restrict seller features to verified users/super admins, including application forms, document uploads, admin approval, and a notification system.
- Critical requirement for **cross-device data synchronization** for all user data (bots, purchases, account, votes, profiles) primarily using Supabase, moving away from device-specific .

    - **Changes**: Updated to use signed URLs for secure document viewing. Added debugging logs.
- : Manages synchronization of user data.
    - **Changes**: This file underwent significant changes. Initially created to sync bots, purchases, accounts, votes. It was then modified to remove *all*  fallbacks as requested by the user, making it pure Supabase. Later,  fallbacks were partially reintroduced for robust error handling when Supabase RLS policies are not correctly applied by the user. Added functions , , . Crucially, fixed a  ID issue during bot saving by ensuring a unique ID is always generated.
- : Component for AI bot creation.
    - **Changes**: Ensured API calls for bot creation are correctly triggered and handled, including a fallback mechanism for Grok API failures.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing comprehensive synchronization issues across the Flow Invest application, particularly focusing on Supabase integration and resolving various  and HTTP 400/406 errors.

The primary goal was to move all data persistence from  to Supabase, ensuring cross-device synchronization. While the bot creation and management (My Bots, Pre-Built Bots) and account balance features were confirmed working and syncing across devices, several other critical sections were reported as still failing or partially working by the user:
-   **Marketplace synchronization**: Products not displayed consistently.
-   **My Purchases**: Not displaying correctly across devices.
-   **Socials**: Not syncing.
-   **Seller Verification Management**: Not syncing.
-   **Profile and other settings**: Inconsistent data.

The AI engineer's most recent actions involved:
1.  **Fixing JavaScript s**: Addressed  in the marketplace/purchases section by adding null checks before string methods. Also fixed  in My Purchases by adding null checks for the  object.
2.  **Marketplace Data Source**: Updated  to completely remove mock data and load portfolios directly from Supabase, ensuring a live and consistent marketplace view for all users.
3.  **Data Sync Service Refinements**: Re-introduced  fallbacks in  for , , , and  after user reported errors, aiming for robust functionality even if Supabase RLS or schema issues persist. Added  and  to .
4.  **Component Updates**: Modified  and  to utilize the  for saving and loading marketplace products and purchases, ensuring data consistency and Supabase integration.
5.  **SQL Script Provision**: A comprehensive SQL script () was provided to the user, intended to:
    *   Add missing columns (like , , , ) to .
    *   Fix/re-create correct RLS policies for , , , and  tables, which were causing the HTTP 400/406 errors.

The last user message confirms that bot creation and cross-device sync for bots is working, but marketplace, purchases, socials, and seller verification are still failing and reported a . The AI engineer has provided SQL to the user to resolve the database-side of these issues.

Current nuances are that frontend components are wired for Supabase, but full functionality is pending the user executing critical SQL schema and RLS policy updates in their Supabase dashboard. Temporary  fallbacks are in place for some data types to ensure basic functionality while permanent Supabase fixes are applied.
