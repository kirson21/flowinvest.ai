The previous AI engineer was tasked with developing an MVP landing page for f01i.ai from scratch, following a detailed specification and reference style. This involved creating a new React application within a landing folder, implementing various UI sections with 3D elements, and configuring complex Vercel routing to integrate with an existing main application and a newly deployed FastAPI backend on Render. A significant portion of the work involved troubleshooting persistent deployment and routing issues across frontend (React), backend (FastAPI/Pydantic), and deployment platforms (Vercel, Render, Supabase). The AI engineer systematically addressed these by updating dependencies, modifying core application logic, and adjusting Vercel configurations. The latest work involves recreating a specific 3D robot and implementing hover animations, with the AI facing access issues to provided project files, leading to a focus on the hover animation.

The primary objective is to develop a high-conversion MVP landing page for f01i.ai, an AI-powered investment platform. The landing page, to be a separate React application, must visually communicate the platform's value and encourage sign-ups. Key design elements include a dark gray, cyan blue, and light beige palette, Comfortaa typography, a minimalist layout with smooth animations, and interactive 3D components like a robot mascot and charts. Specific content for hero, benefit, how-it-works, features, marketplace, and security sections was provided.

The initial implementation involved creating the landing page, fixing mobile responsiveness, and setting up Vercel deployment. Subsequent requirements focused on integrating the landing page with the main Flow Invest application and a FastAPI backend using specific domain routing. This evolved into complex troubleshooting of redirects, domain mismatches, and backend deployment failures on Render, including issues with Rust-dependent Python packages and  typing errors. The goal is a seamless user experience across  (landing),  (main app), and  (backend API). The latest request is to replace the existing 3D orb with a specific 3D robot from a reference project and implement hover animations.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React**: Frontend framework for both landing page and main application.
- **FastAPI**: Backend framework for the API, handling data and business logic.
- **MongoDB**: Database for the main application (not directly modified for landing page).
- **React Three Fiber / Three.js**: For implementing 3D graphics and animations.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Vercel**: Frontend deployment platform for both landing and main applications, heavily utilized for domain routing and rewrites/redirects.
- **Render**: Backend deployment platform, encountered Rust-related build issues.
- **Supabase**: Authentication and database service, integrated with the main app.
- **Yarn / Pip**: Package managers for frontend and backend dependencies.
- **Supervisor**: Process manager for running services locally.

<code_architecture>


- ****: The main FastAPI application entry point.
    - **Changes**: Updated to handle environment variables, downgraded FastAPI and Uvicorn versions for Pydantic v1 compatibility, and simplified imports.
- ****: Lists Python dependencies.
    - **Changes**: Drastically modified to downgrade Pydantic (from v2 to v1.10.13) to avoid Rust compilation issues, and adjusted FastAPI, Uvicorn, and httpx versions for compatibility. Removed  and .
- ****: Environment variables for the backend.
    - **Changes**: Configured , , and Supabase URLs/keys.
- **, , **: Deployment configuration files for Render.
    - **Changes**: New files created to define build and start commands for the backend.
- ****: API route definitions (e.g., , , , ).
    - **Changes**: Modified to remove  imports, adapt to custom Supabase client, and adjust authentication logic to match the new  route. Pydantic models simplified for v1 compatibility.
- ****: Main React application file for the Flow Invest app.
    - **Changes**: Modified routing from  to , including redirects for backward compatibility.
- ****: Handles authentication state and logic.
    - **Changes**: Updated OAuth logic and redirects to use .
- ****: Supabase client configuration.
    - **Changes**: Fixed Google OAuth redirect hardcoded path to use .
- ****: Environment variables for the main frontend.
    - **Changes**: Updated  to point to the deployed Render backend URL ().
- ****: Main frontend project configuration and dependencies.
    - **Changes**: Updated  URL to  to resolve redirection issues.
- ****: Vercel deployment configuration for the main frontend.
    - **Changes**: New file created to route  requests from  to the Render backend.
- ****: A newly created directory for the f01i.ai landing page.
    - **Changes**: Contains a full React application with multiple components, styles, and assets.
- ****: Individual React components for each section of the landing page.
    - **Changes**: , , , ,  had their CTA button links updated multiple times (from  to , then back to  for path-based routing, and finally to direct links like ).  also received mobile padding adjustments and  fix.
- ****: New component for the 3D robot mascot.
    - **Changes**: New file created, implementing a custom 3D robot using React Three Fiber.
- ****: Vercel deployment configuration for the landing page.
    - **Changes**: Initially set up for path-based routing (proxying  and ). Later, completely removed when direct linking to  was adopted as the solution for button redirects.

<pending_tasks>
- Full implementation of the Montek demo's 3D robot with its exact animations, as the previous attempt was a custom recreation due to file access issues.
- Implementing the color-changing hover animation on blocks from the Montek demo, adapted to the f01i.ai color scheme.
- Ensuring the backend has all desired features (AI bots, webhooks, auth) re-added incrementally and tested, as it's currently deployed in a minimal configuration.

<current_work>
The immediate work being addressed is the implementation of visual enhancements for the  landing page. This includes two main parts:
1.  **3D Robot Mascot**: The user requested to replace the existing 3D orb with the specific 3D robot from the Montek demo, aiming for the same robot with the same animation. The AI engineer made an initial attempt by creating a custom  component using React Three Fiber () and integrating it into  and . However, due to issues accessing the full Montek project files from the provided Google Drive link, the AI's implementation is a custom recreation based on the aesthetic, not a direct replication. Screenshots confirm this custom robot is functioning and aesthetically pleasing.
2.  **Color-Changing Hover Animation**: The user also explicitly requested to implement the color-changing hover animation on blocks, similar to the Montek project's interactive elements, while adhering to the  color scheme. The previous AI engineer identified this as the next focus after failing to access the Montek project files for the robot. This task has just begun.

The current state of the product is that the landing page () is deployed on Vercel, the main application () is also deployed on Vercel, and the backend () is deployed on Render. The routing and redirection issues between these domains have been largely addressed by directly linking from the landing page to  and by configuring  in the main app to proxy API calls to the Render backend. The backend itself has been simplified to resolve previous Rust compilation and typing errors, using a minimal FastAPI/Pydantic v1 setup.

<optional_next_step>
I will now work on implementing the color-changing hover animations on the landing page's relevant sections.
