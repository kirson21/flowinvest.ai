The previous AI engineer's primary focus was migrating Flow Invest from  to Supabase for cross-device data synchronization. Initially, this involved fixing UI flickering caused by mock data. The core ongoing challenge revolved around persistent Supabase API errors (404 for , 400 for ) despite the database tables appearing to exist. Iterative debugging, supported by user-provided console logs, revealed a critical  data type mismatch ( instead of ) in the  table and complex Row Level Security (RLS) policy dependencies blocking schema alterations. The engineer systematically generated multiple SQL scripts, refining them to overcome PostgreSQL syntax errors,  meta-command issues, and finally implementing a bulletproof script to explicitly drop all conflicting RLS policies by name, alter the column type, and re-establish correct policies. The  issue was resolved earlier in the process, while the  schema fix was successfully applied just before this summary, confirming the  column as .

<product_requirements>
Flow Invest is an AI-powered investment platform designed for minimalist, scalable, and mobile-responsive use. Key features include an AI Feed, customizable Trading Bots, and a Marketplace for user-generated content with rich editing and a review system. The application uses FastAPI for the backend and Supabase for database operations and authentication (Email/Password, Google OAuth). Implemented features include Grok 4 integration for AI bot creation, a Patreon-like Marketplace with rich editing, advanced bot editing, Reddit-style voting, My Purchases section, Super Admin role for management, and a Seller Verification System. The most critical ongoing requirement is achieving **cross-device data synchronization** for all user data (bots, purchases, account, votes, profiles) via Supabase, fully replacing . Current efforts have transitioned many features, but core challenges remain with reliable portfolio creation/deletion, accurate data display in Marketplace and 'My Purchases', and functional voting/ratings systems.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in an extensive debugging effort to resolve persistent 404 (for ) and 400 (for ) errors from Supabase, which were preventing voting and review functionality. Initial diagnosis, aided by detailed console logs provided by the user, revealed that while the Supabase connection and tables were accessible, there was a fundamental schema mismatch in the  table: the  column was defined as  but was expected to be . This led to database errors like .

The engineer iteratively generated and refined multiple SQL scripts (, , , , , ) to address the issue. This involved navigating through various PostgreSQL syntax errors (like psql meta-commands and quoted identifier issues) and, critically, understanding that  does not drop existing RLS policies. The  functionality was determined to be working earlier, but the persistent  issue required the explicit dropping of all 9 existing RLS policies by their exact names, then altering the  column to , and finally recreating the necessary foreign key constraints and new RLS policies. This database schema fix for  was successfully applied and verified just before this summary. The application-side code in  and  had already been updated to use Supabase for these features.

The immediate next step is to await user confirmation that the voting and review functionality is working correctly within the Flow Invest application's user interface.
